                <p>A <b>ritual</b> is a sequence of activities involving gestures, words, and objects, performed in a special place, and performed according to a set sequence.</p>
                <p><b>Time constraint</b> : 24 hours each day.</p>
                <p><b>Thematic constraint</b> – a set of activities, themes, topics, forms, etc, that you will perform once a day, for 5 days. My theme: <b>Dogs.</b></p>
                <h2> 5 in 5 | Day 1 — AR glasses visualizing a dog’s sense</h2>
                <p>My first day’s project was AR glasses that could visualize a dog’s sense of smell.</p>
                <h3> Research</h3>
                <p>In the beginning, I wanted to explore what the psychological activities of dogs were like, but it was hard to imagine from a psychological level, and no one really knew what the dogs were thinking at any time, and their behavior could only express part of their psychological activities, but not completely. Since I have never owned a dog, I have interviewed several friends who have kept dogs about their habits, and google a lot of basic information about dogs. Dogs’ sense of smell is 1,200 times more sensitive than humans’, and they rely mainly on their sense of smell to get key information from the outside world.</p>
                <p>Why glasses? Because after watching some videos shot by a GoPro attached to a dog, I find that looking at objects from a dog’s perspective is bound to have a different experience. Therefore, I think in order to better understand the psychological activities of dogs, I start with the senses of dogs and let people understand how they feel the world as they were a dog.</p>
                <h2>Process and Demo</h2>
                <p>So I made a prototype of the glasses first.</p>
                <span class="left image"><img src="images/5_in_5/day1/glasses.jpeg"></span>
                <p>Through this pair of glasses, people can keep their human perspective and observe much sensory information of dogs at the same time.</p>
                <p>
                    Because dogs are embedded with sensing chips, the information they receive is sent to their owners in real time. This function can also help the owner to quickly determine the dog’s environment based on the amount of information and prevent the dog from getting lost. It is supposed to look like this.
                </p>

                <p>AR view vs Reality</p></span>
                <h2>5 in 5 | Day 2 — A Dog Zine</h2>
                <p>My second day’s project is a zine of a dog’s story, which illustrates a dog comes to the dog park for the first time.</p>
                <h3> Research</h3>
                <p>In order to learn more about the activity details of dogs, I went to the dog park in Union Square to observe some activity characteristics of dogs and took some video and photos as references.</p>
                <span class="main image"><video width="23%" height="23%" controls>
                    <source src="images/5_in_5/day2/video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                    Your browser does not support the video tag.
                </video>
            <span class="left image"><img style="width: 80%; height: 80%" src="images/5_in_5/day2/r1.jpeg"></span>
                </span>
                <h2>Process</h2>
                <span class="fit image"><img style="width: 400px; height: 500px" src="images/5_in_5/day2/process.jpeg"></span>
                <p>Through Google, I know how to make a simple zine quickly. However, due to the easy penetration of the paper material, I could not use markers as a coloring tool, and because the zine only had 7 pages in total, it took me a lot of time to conceive a very short and interesting story.</p>
